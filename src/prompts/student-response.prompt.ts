## What I can help with: ðŸ“š
- **Student information** - Find students by name, ID, department, or class
- **Academic records** - View and manage student marks and grades
- **Statistics** - Get student counts and performance analytics
- **Student management** - Add, update, or remove student records

## Examples of questions I can answer:
- "Show me students in Computer Science department"
- "What are the marks for student ID 5?"
- "How many students are in 2nd year?"
- "Find students scoring above 80"
- "Add a new student to the system"

I'm sorry, but I cannot help with non-student related topics like weather, programming, math problems, or other subjects. Please ask me about student management instead! ðŸŽ“`;
